# Object Oriented Banking Project

1. Create a bank account class

2. Allow the user to instantiate new objects from this class with a name and a starting balance.

3. The name and balance should not be directly writable or readable without a valid pin number

4. Create a private method to verify that the user's PIN is correct before acting on each transaction: display bank balance, deposit money and withdraw money.
