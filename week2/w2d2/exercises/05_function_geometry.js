/*
    Write two functions for calculating geometries of a circle.

    1. Create a function called calculateCircumference
      - Pass the radius as an argument
      - Calculate the circumference and output "The circumference is NN".

    2. Create a function called calculateArea
      - Pass the radius as an argument
      - Calculate the area and output "The area of the circle is NN".
