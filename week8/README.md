#### Exercises
While these were published to be quizzes, we're going to use them to observe the many options that are available to us with ActiveRecord and how they relate to SQL queries. Go ahead and read the left column, then tap the right column to see the answer.

* [Single Table Queries](http://www.codequizzes.com/learn-sql-with-rails/single-table-queries) - SELECT, CREATE, INSERT
* [Two Table Queries](http://www.codequizzes.com/learn-sql-with-rails/has-many-belongs-to-includes-queries) - has_many, belongs_to, includes
* [Joins](http://www.codequizzes.com/learn-sql-with-rails/has-many-through-join-queries) - has_many :through join queries
* [Intermediate Queries](http://www.codequizzes.com/learn-sql-with-rails/where-order-limit-offset-queries) - WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET


#### Homework
* Add comments to your [Pinterest Project](http://github.com/rcacademy/pinteresting)

#### Mini Project
